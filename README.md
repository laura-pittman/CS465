Architecture

The Angular project structure is vastly different from that of the Express HTML customer-facing page with the main difference being the functionality that each piece provides to the application as the Express HTML is used for more of the backend side of the application while the Angular project structure is used for the front-end, user-facing part of the application. Additionally, the Angular project structure is primarily component based with each component having a separate folder whereas the Express HTML structure follows a server-side MVC pattern with separate HTML files that follow routes and controllers. The backend of the project used a NoSQL MongoDB database because of how simple and easy it was to change the functionality, scaling, and overall view of the app.

Functionality
How is JSON different from Javascript and how does JSON tie together the frontend and backend development pieces?
Provide instances in the full stack process when you refactored code to improve functionality and efficiencies, and name the benefits that come from reusable user interface (UI) components.

Testing
Methods for request and retrieval necessitate various types of API testing of endpoints, in addition to the difficulties of testing with added layers of security. Explain your understanding of methods, endpoints, and security in a full stack application.
